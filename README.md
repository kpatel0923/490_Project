This program allows you to create an account and complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire will ask you finance related questions to determine your investing style. After taking the questionnaire, you will be given a score that will place you in a category. From there you can go to the User Page to look up stocks, charts, and view your recommended stocks based on your quiz score.
This program also features a budgeting tool that allows you to enter your income and expenses to determine how much money you bring in and how much is going out. You can also set a savings goal and frequently update your information to see how much progress you've made.
